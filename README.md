## Spatial Data Analysis in Python 

https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine

**Date**: Thursday, September 21st, 18:00 - 20:00 CEST (Rome, Berlin, Paris timezone)

**Speaker**: Nils Ratnaweera is a research associate at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences and also works as a data scientist at his own firm http://ratnaweera.xyz . His research and his work focuses on the analysis of spatial data and their application in environmental contexts such as hydrology, agriculture, wildlife and vegetation ecology.

**Description**: In this workshop, you will get a gentle, hands-on introduction to spatial analysis in python. We will touch on raster and vector data analysis, have a look at some spatial data formats and of course make some maps! If there is room, we will also have a look at some blazingly fast commandline tools which are the motor behind most spatial libraries.

## Preperation

To follow along in the workshop, please install the following software:

- If you don't have a recent python version (> 3.9) on your system, install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.
- Next, install [`miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html). This is optional if you are familiar with a different python package manager
- Optional: Install `geopandas` and `rasterio` from `conda-forge`
- Lastly, install [jupyter lab desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop#installation). Again, this is optional if you you know your way around a different IDE and have it customized for python.
